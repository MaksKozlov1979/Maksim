# Localizations

1. Copy the `en.json` file and rename it
_use the base version of the language (en) instead of a country specific version (en_US)_
2. Replace the strings with the language you're translating
3. Add the language to `Sources/App/Extensions/Router+Extensions.swift` under `supportedLanguages`
4. Create a pull request to get your translation approved and merged

Thank you for help with localizing gitignore
